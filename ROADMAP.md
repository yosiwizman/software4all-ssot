# Software 4 All — Roadmap

## Overview

Phased plan from initial setup to a functioning AI software factory. Each phase has clear goals, outputs, and exit criteria. Phases are sequential — do not skip ahead.

---

## Phase 0: SSOT Foundation — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish the canonical documentation and governance structure so all future work has a reference point.

**Outputs:**
- This repo created and populated
- All canonical docs written with real content
- Decision log initialized
- Agent roles defined
- Delivery pipeline documented

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] All 11 required docs exist with substantive content
- [ ] CEO has reviewed and approved the operating model
- [x] Repo is committed and pushed

---

## Phase 1: Security and Machine Baseline — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Lock down the machine, close known gaps, establish security standards as enforceable practice.

**Outputs:**
- UFW firewall active (deny incoming, allow outgoing, enabled on startup)
- Ports 3000/3002 exposure resolved
- Remote access consolidated to RustDesk (DEC-014)
- Secrets management policy baseline established (DEC-015)
- Runtime port ownership formalized — S4A on 3100, Jarvis on 3000-3002 (DEC-016)
- CURRENT_STATE.md updated with confirmed security state

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] UFW active with default-deny incoming
- [x] No unexpected ports exposed to network
- [x] Single remote access method chosen and documented
- [x] Secrets management approach decided and logged in DECISIONS_LOG.md

---

## Phase 2: Runtime Completion — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Install all missing approved tools so the factory has a complete runtime.

**Outputs:**
- Docker installed and verified
- uv installed and verified
- CUDA/cuDNN audit completed and upgrade path documented
- GPU routing rules documented
- CURRENT_STATE.md and INSTALL_BASELINE.md updated

**Progress (2026-04-09):**
- uv v0.11.6 installed and verified
- CUDA/cuDNN audit completed — CUDA 12.0 toolkit functional, upgrade to 13.x deferred (not trivial, no project currently requires it). Ollama bundles its own CUDA 13 + cuDNN 9.20 internally.
- Docker 29.1.3 installed by CEO, verified (`hello-world` passed)
- GPU routing rules documented (DEC-018) — GPU0 primary compute, GPU1 overflow, GPU2 display-reserved

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Docker installed and `docker run hello-world` succeeds (v29.1.3)
- [x] `uv --version` succeeds (v0.11.6)
- [x] CUDA/cuDNN status audited and documented (upgrade deferred by recommendation, see CURRENT_STATE.md)
- [x] All agents in AGENT_ROLE_MATRIX.md have working runtimes (spot-checked 2026-04-09)
- [x] GPU routing rules documented (DEC-018, see CURRENT_STATE.md)

---

## Phase 3: Standardization — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Ensure consistent project structure, repo conventions, and workspace organization.

**Outputs:**
- Standard project repo template created (`templates/project-repo/`)
- Workspace directory structure documented (CURRENT_STATE.md, STACK_STANDARD.md)
- AKIOR repos verified as distinct (governance vs application) — not duplicates
- pnpm/bun path standardization resolved and documented
- Workspace directory conventions established (STACK_STANDARD.md)
- Paperclip runtime/CLI naming clarified

**Phase 3A (2026-04-09):**
- Workspace audit completed — all repos catalogued in CURRENT_STATE.md
- AKIOR "duplicate" repos investigated — found to be two distinct repos (governance vs application), not duplicates. Risk entry corrected.
- pnpm install path documented (npm global, not corepack). Bun confirmed runtime-only (no global installs).
- Paperclip runtime/CLI naming clarified — no global binary, runs via `pnpm dev`, CLI via `pnpm paperclipai`.
- Undocumented port 13100 (Paperclip secondary listener) added to port ownership table.
- Workspace directory conventions added to STACK_STANDARD.md.

**Phase 3B (2026-04-09):**
- Standard project repo template created at `templates/project-repo/`
- Template includes: README.md, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, docs/, TEMPLATE_USAGE.md
- Stack-agnostic scaffold — builder agents add language/framework files during build
- Usage guide documents the full workflow: intake → scaffold → build
- SSOT.md and README.md updated to cross-reference the template

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Project template exists and is usable (`templates/project-repo/` with usage guide)
- [x] No duplicate repos for same project (verified — ~/akior and ~/projects/akior are distinct repos with different remotes and purposes)
- [x] Package manager paths are clean and unambiguous (pnpm via npm global, bun runtime-only, no conflicts)
- [x] Conventions documented in this repo (workspace conventions in STACK_STANDARD.md, workspace structure in CURRENT_STATE.md)

---

## Phase 4: Pilot Project Flow — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Run one real project through the full delivery pipeline end to end. Validate the factory works.

**Outputs:**
- One project taken from intake to deployed artifact
- Pipeline bottlenecks identified
- Agent handoff quality assessed
- Token cost measured
- Time-to-delivery measured
- Lessons learned documented

**Pilot selected (Phase 4A — 2026-04-09):**
- **Project:** s4a-factory-dashboard — local status dashboard for the CEO
- **Selection report:** `reports/phase4-pilot-selection.md`
- **Intake form:** `reports/phase4-pilot-intake.md`
- **Repo:** `~/projects/s4a-factory-dashboard`

**Pilot built (Phase 4B — 2026-04-09):**
- CEO scope approval granted
- Repo scaffolded from `templates/project-repo/`, placeholders filled
- server.js built: single-file Node.js dashboard on localhost:3200
- HTML dashboard + JSON API (`/api/status`)

- Machine vitals: hostname, uptime, load, RAM, 3x GPU (nvidia-smi)
- SSOT phases: parsed from ROADMAP.md (5 phases shown correctly)
- 6/6 smoke tests pass (node --test)
- Live verification: HTML serves, JSON valid, 404 correct, port 3200 confirmed
- Zero external dependencies — Node.js built-in modules only
- Pipeline report: `reports/phase4-pilot-report.md`

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Pilot project delivered and working (localhost:3200, 6/6 tests pass)
- [x] Pipeline report written in `reports/` (`reports/phase4-pilot-report.md`)
- [x] At least 3 improvement items identified (6 items documented in pilot report)
- [x] DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md updated with lessons learned

---

## Phase 5: Production Hardening — COMPLETE

**Goal:** Make the factory reliable enough for repeated use with confidence.

**Outputs:**
- Automated testing in pipeline
- Observability basics (logs, error tracking)
- Backup and rollback procedures tested
- GPU scheduling if multi-project concurrency needed
- Cost tracking per project
- Runbook for common failure modes

**Phase 5A — Hardening pack 1 (2026-04-09):**
- Pilot repo cleanup: removed TEMPLATE_USAGE.md, fixed SSOT template copy instructions
- Added package.json with start/test/test:browser scripts (zero runtime deps)
- Added RUNBOOK.md — CEO-readable operator guide (start, stop, test, verify, troubleshoot, rollback)
- Added Playwright browser smoke tests: 2 tests (page sections + JSON API) — 2/2 pass
- Ran Codex review (codex-cli 0.118.0, gpt-5.4): 2 findings, both fixed:
  - P1: Hardened smoke test before() hook (rejects on server crash instead of masking)
  - P2: Added HTML escaping for all dynamic content (XSS prevention)
- Total test coverage: 8/8 (6 node + 2 Playwright)
- Hardening report: `reports/phase5a-hardening-report.md`

**Phase 5B — Hardening pack 2 (2026-04-09):**
- PORT configurable via env var (default 3200, localhost-only)
- ops/dashboard.sh: start/stop/status/restart with PID tracking
- ops/s4a-dashboard.service: systemd user service — installed, enabled, verified
- Auto-starts on user login via `loginctl enable-linger`
- Backup/restore drill passed: cloned from GitHub → tests pass (6/6) → dashboard serves correctly → cleanup complete
- RUNBOOK.md expanded: systemd commands, restore-from-GitHub procedure, custom port, troubleshooting
- Hardening report: `reports/phase5b-deployment-restore-report.md`

**Phase 5C — Pipeline repeatability + CEO trigger (2026-04-09):**
- Restore proof re-run: latest pilot (8d317f9) cloned from GitHub → 6/6 tests pass on port 3201 → HTML + JSON serve correctly → 127.0.0.1 only → cleaned up
- CEO trigger artifact: "How to start a new project" quickstart added to DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md (5 steps, ~5 min CEO involvement)
- Second project delivered end-to-end: s4a-service-snapshot-cli
  - Scaffolded from `templates/project-repo/` (TEMPLATE_USAGE.md correctly excluded)
  - CLI built: `node snapshot.js` (human-readable) / `node snapshot.js --json` (machine-readable)
  - Checks: Paperclip, Ollama, OpenClaw reachability, Docker availability, SSOT phase summary
  - Zero external dependencies
  - 5/5 tests pass
  - Pushed to github.com/yosiwizman/s4a-service-snapshot-cli
- Closeout report: `reports/phase5c-closeout-report.md`

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Can start a new project and have reasonable confidence it will complete (second project s4a-service-snapshot-cli delivered end-to-end — template → intake → scaffold → build → test → push)
- [x] Failure modes documented with recovery steps (RUNBOOK.md in pilot repo)
- [x] Backup/restore tested at least once (GitHub clone → test → serve on port 3201 → verified)
- [x] CEO can trigger a project build with minimal involvement (CEO quickstart in DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md — 5 steps, ~5 min)

---

## Phase 6: Slice Orchestration Backend

**Goal:** Build s4a-slice-orchestrator — the backend execution and verification layer that enforces tiny, durable, policy-checked delivery slices with an explicit state machine, transition guards, evidence packets, and human approval gates.

**Why a new phase (not Phase 5C):** Phase 5 hardens the existing factory. Phase 6 adds a new factory subsystem — a structured execution backend that operationalizes existing SSOT doctrine (slice rules, retry policy, stop conditions, claim classification) into enforceable runtime logic. It does not replace doctrine — it enforces it programmatically.

**Relationship to existing factory:**
- s4a-slice-orchestrator is factory-owned backend logic
- It is NOT the SSOT (governance stays here)
- It is NOT a Paperclip fork (Paperclip remains the upstream control plane)
- It sits between Paperclip and builder agents, enforcing slice discipline at the execution layer

**Subsystem stack:**
- **Workflow runtime:** Temporal (durable execution, retry, replay, resume)
- **Policy/authorization:** Cedar (declarative policy checks before state transitions)
- **Verification/model checking:** TLA+ + Apalache (formal spec of state machine, checked before implementation)
- **Proof-only critical validators (deferred):** Dafny (mathematical proof for safety-critical transition guards — build later, not in MVP)

**Implementation law — NASA Power of Ten:**
1. Simple control flow — no recursion, no goto
2. Bounded loops — all loops have a fixed upper bound
3. No dynamic memory after initialization
4. Small functions — no function longer than one printed page (~60 lines)
5. Assertions — at least 2 assertions per function
6. Minimal scope — declare variables at the smallest possible scope
7. Checked returns — every return value checked, every error handled
8. Zero-warning discipline — compiler/linter warnings are errors
9. Tool-verifiable rules first — if a tool can check it, the tool must check it
10. No hidden complexity — every side effect is visible in the function signature

**Intake:** `reports/phase6-slice-orchestrator-intake.md`
**MVP plan:** `reports/phase6-slice-orchestrator-mvp-plan.md`
**Repo:** `~/projects/s4a-slice-orchestrator` (created, pushed to github.com/yosiwizman/s4a-slice-orchestrator)

**Phase 6A — Formal specification (2026-04-09):**
- CEO scope approval granted for Phase 6A (spec-first only)
- Repo scaffolded from `templates/project-repo/` (TEMPLATE_USAGE.md excluded)
- TLA+ formal state machine specification written: `spec/tla/SliceMachine.tla`
  - 12 states modeled (expanded from original 8 to include SCOPED, VERIFYING, AWAITING_APPROVAL, APPROVED, RETRY_PENDING)
  - 16 transitions with explicit guards
  - 6 checked invariants + structural invariants
  - Model-checking config: `spec/tla/MC.tla`, `spec/tla/MC.cfg`
  - Operator docs: `spec/tla/README.md`
- No runtime code, no infrastructure changes, no package installs

**Phase 6A — Verification completion (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved local verification tooling install
- OpenJDK upgraded from 8 to 17.0.18 (Ubuntu repos, required by Apalache)
- TLC 2.19 installed at `~/tools/tlaplus/tla2tools.jar`
- Apalache 0.56.1 installed at `~/tools/apalache/`
- Spec fixes for model checking: MC.tla syntax, Apalache type annotations, state constraint for bounded checking, terminal state stuttering
- TLC result: 4,886 states generated, 2,061 distinct, depth 37, **zero violations**
- Apalache result: bounded model checking to depth 10, **EXITCODE: OK, NoError**
- Both tools independently confirm all 6 invariants hold
- Repo visibility corrected from PUBLIC to PRIVATE (DEC-023)

**Phase 6B — Durable execution spine (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 6B (Codex review + minimal Temporal spine)
- Codex review of TLA+ spec: 1 P0, 3 P1, 4 P2 findings
  - P0 fixed: removed dead `rollbackComplete` variable
  - P1 fixed: DRAFT/SCOPED added to rollback set
  - P1 fixed: retryCount reset on BlockedToScoped
  - P1 deferred: testsPass invariant for DEPLOYED (vacuously true)
  - P2s deferred (VERIFYING failure path, approval rejection, coupled test/commit, comment-only invariants)
  - Re-verified: TLC 5,849 states / 2,321 distinct / zero violations; Apalache OK
- Temporal CLI 1.6.2 installed (`~/.temporalio/bin/temporal`)
- TypeScript Temporal workflow implemented: `sliceWorkflow` (DRAFT → SCOPED → BUILDING)
  - Signal-based pause at SCOPED (assignBuilder signal)
  - Query handlers: getState, getHistory
  - @temporalio/workflow 1.15.0
- **Durability proven:** workflow started → paused at SCOPED → worker killed → worker restarted → state preserved (SCOPED) → signal sent → advanced to BUILDING → workflow completed with full transition history
- Stale lifecycle wording fixed in project README.md and ROADMAP.md exit criteria

**Phase 6C — Evidence packets, Cedar guards, approval gate (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 6C (evidence + Cedar + approval)
- Evidence packets: JSON files persisted to `evidence/<sliceId>/` at every transition
  - 9 required fields: sliceId, timestamp, fromState, toState, actor, decision, checksRun, result, notes
  - 6 packets emitted in proof run, all persisted on disk
- Cedar policy guards: `@cedar-policy/cedar-wasm` 4.9.1 (local WASM, no services)
  - 5 policies in `policies/guards.cedar` guarding 5 transitions
  - Cedar schema in `policies/schema.cedarschema`
  - Evaluated as Temporal activity before each guarded transition
- Human approval gate: workflow pauses at AWAITING_APPROVAL until explicit `approve` signal
  - Cedar policy `approval_required` enforces `approvalGranted=true` before APPROVED
  - Proven: workflow blocked at AWAITING_APPROVAL, advanced only after signal
- Workflow extended: DRAFT → SCOPED → BUILDING → REVIEWING → VERIFYING → AWAITING_APPROVAL → APPROVED
- New signals: reportTests, reportReview, approve

**Phase 6D — Failure paths, DEPLOYED, pipeline integration (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 6D (DENY/retry/rollback, DEPLOYED, pipeline doc)
- Cedar DENY path proven: BUILDING→REVIEWING denied when tests fail → BLOCKED
  - DENY evidence packet emitted with `decision: "DENY"`
- Retry path proven: BLOCKED→SCOPED via retry signal (retryCount reset per TLA+ T14)
- Rollback path proven: BUILDING→ROLLED_BACK via rollback signal (per TLA+ T16)
- DEPLOYED transition proven: APPROVED→DEPLOYED via deploy signal (per TLA+ T13)
- Full 12-state type implemented in runtime (all states in SliceState union)
- Proof script (src/proof.ts): 4 proofs, ALL PASS, 21 evidence packets across 3 workflows
- Delivery pipeline integration documented in DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md
  - Pipeline stage → orchestrator state mapping
  - Failure handling → orchestrator state mapping
  - Usage guide and future integration points

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] State machine formally specified in TLA+ and checked by Apalache
- [x] Core Temporal workflow running locally with slice lifecycle — **all 12 states implemented, happy path reaches DEPLOYED, failure paths reach BLOCKED/ROLLED_BACK**
- [x] Cedar policies enforce at least 3 transition guards — **5 policies guard 5 transitions, DENY proven**
- [x] Evidence packet emitted at each state transition — **21 packets in proof run (7 happy + 11 deny-retry + 3 rollback)**
- [x] Human approval gate verified for at least one risky transition — **AWAITING_APPROVAL → APPROVED**
- [x] Retry/rollback paths tested — **BLOCKED→SCOPED retry proven, ANY→ROLLED_BACK proven**
- [x] Integration with existing delivery pipeline documented — **DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md updated**

---

## Phase 7: Control-Plane Integration

**Goal:** Connect the proven slice orchestrator to the factory control plane safely, starting with a local adapter shim that external orchestrators (eventually Paperclip) can call.

**Why a new phase:** Phase 6 built and proved the orchestrator in isolation. Phase 7 makes it callable by external systems without modifying those systems directly.

**Approach — adapter-shim-first (DEC-026):**
- Build a local CLI adapter that accepts structured JSON commands and returns structured JSON responses
- The adapter wraps the existing Temporal client/signal paths — no new runtime logic
- Paperclip (or any control plane) can invoke the adapter as a subprocess
- No direct Paperclip repo modifications — the adapter is the integration boundary
- No HTTP server unless explicitly needed later

**Relationship to existing factory:**
- The adapter sits between the control plane and the orchestrator
- It does not replace Paperclip — it provides a contract Paperclip can call
- Builder agents report via the same adapter contract (signals routed through it)

**Repo:** `~/projects/s4a-slice-orchestrator` (same repo — adapter is part of the orchestrator)

**Phase 7A — Adapter shim implementation (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 7A (adapter shim only)
- `src/adapter.ts`: single CLI entrypoint, 10 commands, JSON in/out
- `docs/ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md`: full contract spec for external callers
- Contract: `node dist/adapter.js <command> '<json>'` → JSON stdout
- Proof: full lifecycle (DRAFT → DEPLOYED) driven entirely through adapter
  - 7 commands, 7 evidence packets, all `ok: true`
  - No manual signal.js or client.js used
- Builder-agent reporting path documented (reportTests/reportReview via adapter)
- No external repos modified (DEC-026 constraint satisfied)

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Local adapter CLI accepts all orchestrator commands via structured JSON — **10 commands implemented**
- [x] Adapter returns machine-friendly JSON output for every command — **{ok, command, data} format**
- [x] At least one end-to-end lifecycle driven entirely through the adapter — **DRAFT → DEPLOYED proven**
- [x] Adapter contract documented for external callers — **docs/ADAPTER_CONTRACT.md**
- [x] Builder-agent reporting path documented (signal contract) — **reportTests/reportReview in contract**
- [x] No external repos modified — **confirmed**

**Phase 7B — Task-envelope harness (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 7B (envelope contract + harness)
- Architecture refactor: extracted `adapter-core.ts` as shared logic
- `src/harness.ts`: envelope-based CLI — validates versioned envelopes, routes to adapter core
- Request envelope: `{version, requestId, command, payload, caller, timestamp}`
- Response envelope: `{ok, version, requestId, command, data?, error?, timestamp}`
- Agent reporting: builder agents (opencode, claude-code) and reviewers (codex) call through same contract
- `docs/ENVELOPE_CONTRACT.md`: full specification with agent examples
- Proof: full lifecycle driven entirely through harness (7 commands, 7 evidence packets, all versioned envelopes)
- No external repos modified

---

## Phase 8: External-Caller Hardening

**Goal:** Make the orchestrator's control-plane interface production-grade for external callers — agents, control planes, scripts — without touching any external repo.

**Phase 8A — Subprocess-grade caller pack (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 8A (harness hardening + agent helpers + subprocess proof)
- Harness hardened: `errorCode` field on all error responses for machine classification
  - Error codes: INVALID_JSON, ENVELOPE_VALIDATION, UNKNOWN_COMMAND, MISSING_FIELD, CONNECTION_FAILED, WORKFLOW_ERROR, INTERNAL_ERROR
  - stderr suppressed (stdout always clean parseable JSON)
  - Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = structured error
- Agent helper scripts (`bin/`): create-slice.sh, get-state.sh, report-tests.sh, report-review.sh
  - Auto-build envelopes, call harness via subprocess
  - Default callers: paperclip, opencode, codex
- Envelope examples (`examples/`): 6 ready-to-copy JSON files
- Subprocess proof: 10 tests via child_process.execSync, ALL PASS
  - Full lifecycle DRAFT→DEPLOYED through subprocess
  - Invalid JSON → structured INVALID_JSON error
  - Unknown command → structured UNKNOWN_COMMAND error
  - 7 evidence packets persisted
- No external repos modified

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Harness returns structured error envelopes with errorCode for all failure modes
- [x] Agent helper scripts for builder/reviewer reporting
- [x] Subprocess-grade proof (child_process.execSync) for full lifecycle + errors
- [x] Envelope examples for common commands
- [x] Documentation updated with error handling, exit codes, subprocess pattern
- [x] No external repos modified

**Phase 8B — Paperclip-ready wrapper (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 8B (wrapper + timeout/retry + helper reroute)
- `src/wrapper.ts`: stdin JSON input, calls harness as subprocess
  - Timeout: 30s default (S4A_TIMEOUT_MS env override)
  - Retry: max 2 retries for CONNECTION_FAILED/TIMEOUT only (1s, 2s backoff)
  - No retry for validation/workflow errors
  - retryAttempt field in response envelope
- Helper scripts rerouted through wrapper (stdin pipe)
- Architecture: Control Plane → wrapper (stdin) → harness (subprocess) → adapter-core → Temporal
- Wrapper proof: 11 tests via stdin pipe subprocess, ALL PASS
  - Full lifecycle DRAFT→DEPLOYED, error cases, retry metadata, 7 evidence packets
- No external repos modified

---

## Phase 9: Paperclip Integration

**Goal:** Connect the slice orchestrator to the live Paperclip control plane so slices can be managed through the existing factory interface.

**Approach — opt-in bridge first (DEC-027):**
- One new Express route in the Paperclip server, gated behind `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1`
- When disabled (default): zero behavior change, no new routes mounted
- When enabled: POST `/api/s4a-orchestrator` accepts envelope JSON, spawns wrapper subprocess, returns response
- Subprocess boundary retained: Paperclip → wrapper (stdin) → harness → adapter-core → Temporal
- No broad Paperclip refactor, no UI changes, no schema changes

**Paperclip repo:** `~/paperclip` (upstream: paperclipai/paperclip, branch: master)

**Phase 9A — Opt-in bridge implementation (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 9A (opt-in bridge only)
- Paperclip repo discovered: `~/paperclip` (PID 2003313, master branch, upstream paperclipai/paperclip)
- Bridge route: `server/src/routes/s4a-orchestrator.ts`
  - POST `/api/s4a-orchestrator` — accepts envelope JSON, spawns wrapper subprocess
  - Gated behind `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1` env var
  - When disabled: 404, zero behavior change (proven)
  - When enabled: all 10 commands available via Paperclip HTTP
- Mount: `server/src/app.ts` — conditional after instanceSettingsRoutes
- Proof: full lifecycle DRAFT→DEPLOYED through `curl localhost:3100/api/s4a-orchestrator`
  - 7 commands, 7 evidence packets, all ok:true
- Bridge docs: `s4a-slice-orchestrator/docs/PAPERCLIP_BRIDGE.md`
- Paperclip commit: local only (39d60408), not pushed to upstream (paperclipai/paperclip)
- No unrelated repos modified

**Exit criteria:**
- [x] Opt-in bridge route added to Paperclip behind env gate
- [x] Bridge disabled by default — no behavior change (404 proven)
- [x] createSlice works through Paperclip bridge
- [x] getState works through Paperclip bridge
- [x] Full lifecycle through bridge — **DRAFT→DEPLOYED, 7 commands, 7 evidence packets**
- [x] Evidence packets still persist in orchestrator (7 packets)
- [x] Bridge documented (docs/PAPERCLIP_BRIDGE.md)
- [x] No unrelated repos modified

**Phase 9B — Bridge stabilization (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 9B (stabilize + refactor + smoke proof)
- Branch protection: `s4a-orchestrator-bridge` branch created in Paperclip
- Fork created: `yosiwizman/paperclip` (GitHub fork of paperclipai/paperclip)
- Bridge branch pushed to fork (NOT to upstream)
- Refactored into route + service:
  - `server/src/services/s4a-orchestrator-bridge.ts`: config resolution, subprocess execution, error builder
  - `server/src/routes/s4a-orchestrator.ts`: thin POST handler, delegates to service
- Repeatable smoke proof: `server/scripts/s4a-bridge-smoke.sh`
  - Disabled mode: 404, 1 pass
  - Enabled mode: full lifecycle DRAFT→DEPLOYED, 10 passes, 7 evidence packets
- Env-gated behavior verified unchanged after refactor

---

## Phase 10: Default-Builder Auto-Assign

**Goal:** After a successful `createSlice` through the Paperclip bridge, automatically assign the factory's default builder (OpenCode) without requiring a separate manual `assignBuilder` call.

**Phase 10 — Default-builder auto-assign (2026-04-09):**
- CEO approved Phase 10 (default-builder auto-assign only)
- Three-gate opt-in model:
  1. `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1` (bridge enabled)
  2. `S4A_BRIDGE_AUTO_ASSIGN=1` (env gate)
  3. `payload.autoAssign: true` (request-level opt-in)
- Default builder: `opencode` (per AGENT_ROLE_MATRIX.md, DELIVERY_PIPELINE.md)
- Implementation: `autoAssignAfterCreate()` in bridge service, called from route after successful createSlice
- Response enriched with `autoAssign.{ok, agentId, state}` when fired
- All three gates off by default — existing behavior unchanged
- Smoke proof extended: autoassign-off (3/3), autoassign-on (4/4), autoassign-noop (3/3)
- Paperclip commit: 60e820ab pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 11: Build-Result Reporting

**Goal:** Formalize the builder-agent test-result reporting path through the Paperclip bridge using the canonical `reportTests` command.

**Phase 11 — Build-result reporting (2026-04-09):**
- No new env gate needed — `reportTests` already supported by the generic bridge when `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1`
- No new route/service code — the existing bridge handles it generically
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-report-tests.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proofs for pass and fail paths
- Canonical envelope: `{command:"reportTests", payload:{workflowId, pass:bool, commit:bool}, caller:"opencode"}`
- State transitions proven:
  - `pass:true` → BUILDING → REVIEWING (Cedar allows)
  - `pass:false` → BUILDING → BLOCKED (Cedar denies BUILDING→REVIEWING)
- Smoke proofs: report-pass (4/4 PASS), report-fail (4/4 PASS)
- Existing lifecycle and auto-assign behavior verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: e8eea0cd pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 12: Reviewer-Result Reporting

**Goal:** Formalize the reviewer-agent review-result reporting path through the Paperclip bridge using the canonical `reportReview` command.

**Phase 12 — Reviewer-result reporting (2026-04-09):**
- No new env gate needed — `reportReview` already supported by the generic bridge when `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1`
- No new route/service code — the existing bridge handles it generically
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-report-review.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proofs for approve and reject paths
- Canonical envelope: `{command:"reportReview", payload:{workflowId, approved:bool}, caller:"codex"}`
- Canonical reviewer: `codex` (per AGENT_ROLE_MATRIX.md)
- State transitions proven:
  - `approved:true` → REVIEWING → VERIFYING → AWAITING_APPROVAL
  - `approved:false` → stays in REVIEWING (awaiting new review)
- Smoke proofs: review-approve (4/4 PASS), review-reject (4/4 PASS)
- Existing lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 8fdaca33 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

## Phase 13: CEO Approval Formalization

**Goal:** Formalize the CEO approval gate through the Paperclip bridge using the canonical `approve` command.

**Phase 13 — CEO approval formalization (2026-04-09):**
- No new env gate needed — `approve` already supported by the generic bridge when `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1`
- No new route/service code — the existing bridge handles it generically
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-approve.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proof for approval path
- Canonical envelope: `{command:"approve", payload:{workflowId}, caller:"ceo"}`
- Canonical caller: `ceo` (per AGENT_ROLE_MATRIX.md — CEO is final approver)
- State transition proven: AWAITING_APPROVAL → APPROVED (Cedar `approval_required` policy)
- Smoke proofs: approve (3/3 PASS)
- Existing lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 54a8d176 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 14: Deploy Formalization

**Goal:** Formalize the deploy step through the Paperclip bridge using the canonical `deploy` command.

**Phase 14 — Deploy formalization (2026-04-09):**
- No new env gate needed — `deploy` already supported by the generic bridge when `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1`
- No new route/service code — the existing bridge handles it generically
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-deploy.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proof for deploy path with evidence check
- Canonical envelope: `{command:"deploy", payload:{workflowId}, caller:"ceo"}`
- Canonical caller: `ceo`
- State transition proven: APPROVED → DEPLOYED (terminal, workflow completes)
- Evidence: deploy evidence packet persisted (`APPROVED_DEPLOYED.json`)
- Smoke proofs: deploy (3/3 PASS)
- Existing lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 32369746 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

**Full Paperclip-bridge pipeline now formalized:**
All happy-path pipeline stages have dedicated Paperclip-side helpers and smoke proofs:
1. `createSlice` → SCOPED (Phase 9)
2. `assignBuilder` → BUILDING (Phase 10 auto-assign)
3. `reportTests` → REVIEWING or BLOCKED (Phase 11)
4. `reportReview` → AWAITING_APPROVAL or stays REVIEWING (Phase 12)
5. `approve` → APPROVED (Phase 13)
6. `deploy` → DEPLOYED (Phase 14)

---

## Phase 15: End-to-End Happy-Path Automation

**Goal:** One script runs the complete slice lifecycle through the Paperclip bridge from createSlice to DEPLOYED.

**Phase 15 — Chained happy-path automation (2026-04-09):**
- No new env gate needed — uses `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1` only
- No new route/service code — uses explicit per-step bridge calls
- Added: `server/scripts/s4a-happy-path.sh [description] [sliceId]`
  - Runs: createSlice → assignBuilder(opencode) → reportTests(pass) → reportReview(approve) → approve → deploy
  - Prints stage-by-stage PASS/FAIL + evidence summary
- Smoke proof: `bash server/scripts/s4a-bridge-smoke.sh happy-path`
- Proof result: 7/7 stages PASS, 7 evidence packets, DEPLOYED terminal state
- Existing step-by-step lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 7bd8b4c9 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 16: Failure-Path Recovery

**Goal:** Formalize the canonical recovery primitive after a failed build/test report through the Paperclip bridge.

**Phase 16 — Failure-path recovery (2026-04-09):**
- Existing `retry` command already supported by the orchestrator (Phase 6D) and the generic bridge
- No new env gate needed — uses `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1` only
- No new orchestrator code — retry signal and BLOCKED→SCOPED transition already implemented
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-retry.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proof for full fail→BLOCKED→retry→SCOPED→reassign flow
- Recovery flow: `reportTests(fail) → BLOCKED → retry → SCOPED → assignBuilder → BUILDING`
- State transitions proven:
  - BUILDING → BLOCKED (Cedar DENY on failed tests)
  - BLOCKED → SCOPED (retry: retryCount reset, builder cleared, tests cleared)
  - Post-recovery: SCOPED → BUILDING (reassignment succeeds)
- Smoke proofs: retry (4/4 PASS)
- Existing happy-path lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: f5518f13 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 17: Builder Escalation

**Goal:** Formalize the escalation path from failed OpenCode build to Claude Code reassignment through the Paperclip bridge.

**Phase 17 — Builder escalation (2026-04-09):**
- Discovery: the orchestrator does NOT track cross-retry attempt counts. The "2 tries then Claude" policy (DEC-003) cannot be automatically enforced from current system state.
- Implementation: explicit manual escalation helper — correct and useful without faking policy enforcement
- No new env gate needed — uses existing bridge commands only
- No new orchestrator code — uses existing `retry` + `assignBuilder`
- Added: `server/scripts/s4a-escalate.sh <workflowId> [caller]`
  - Checks BLOCKED state
  - Issues retry → SCOPED
  - Issues assignBuilder with `agentId: claude-code` → BUILDING
  - Verifies result including builder identity from evidence
- Escalation flow: `BUILDING(opencode) → reportTests(fail) → BLOCKED → escalate → retry → SCOPED → assignBuilder(claude-code) → BUILDING(claude-code)`
- Builder identity proven from evidence packet: `actor: "claude-code"`
- Smoke proofs: escalate (4/4 PASS)
- Existing happy-path lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: ea94eb10 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified
- **Policy note:** Phase 17 provided explicit manual escalation. Phase 18 (below) adds the data model for automatic policy enforcement.

---

## Phase 18: Policy-Aware Builder Routing

**Goal:** Add the minimum orchestrator-side state needed for safe automatic enforcement of the "2 tries then Claude" escalation policy (DEC-003).

**Phase 18 — Policy-aware builder routing (2026-04-09):**
- Orchestrator extended (smallest change):
  - `buildFailCount`: durable counter, increments on every BUILDING→BLOCKED, does NOT reset on retry
  - `getStatus` query: returns `{ state, builderAgentId, buildFailCount }` — backward-compatible (getState unchanged)
  - `getStatus` command added to adapter-core and harness VALID_COMMANDS
- Policy-aware helper: `server/scripts/s4a-policy-route.sh <workflowId> [caller]`
  - Reads `buildFailCount` from `getStatus`
  - `buildFailCount < 2` → retry + assign opencode
  - `buildFailCount >= 2` → retry + assign claude-code
- No new env gate — uses existing bridge
- Proofs:
  - 1st fail: `buildFailCount=1` → policy chooses opencode (PASS)
  - 2nd fail: `buildFailCount=2` → policy chooses claude-code (PASS)
  - Existing happy-path lifecycle unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Orchestrator commit: 8164f25 pushed to github.com/yosiwizman/s4a-slice-orchestrator
- Paperclip commit: 91b12c43 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 19: Rollback Formalization

**Goal:** Formalize the terminal rollback path through the Paperclip bridge.

**Phase 19 — Rollback formalization (2026-04-09):**
- Existing `rollback` command already supported by orchestrator (Phase 6D) and generic bridge
- No new env gate needed — uses `S4A_ORCHESTRATOR_BRIDGE=1` only
- No new orchestrator code
- Added: convenience helper `server/scripts/s4a-rollback.sh`
- Added: dedicated smoke proof with evidence check + terminal behavior verification
- Supported source states: SCOPED, BUILDING, REVIEWING, VERIFYING, AWAITING_APPROVAL, APPROVED, BLOCKED, RETRY_PENDING, FAILED
- NOT supported from: DRAFT, DEPLOYED, ROLLED_BACK
- State transition proven: BUILDING → ROLLED_BACK (terminal)
- Evidence: rollback evidence packet persisted
- Terminal behavior proven: assignBuilder rejected after rollback (ok=false)
- Smoke proofs: rollback (4/4 PASS)
- Existing happy-path lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 30b9b2ad pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

**Full Paperclip-bridge control-plane surface now complete:**
All lifecycle primitives formalized with helpers and smoke proofs:
- Happy path: createSlice → assignBuilder → reportTests → reportReview → approve → deploy → DEPLOYED
- Failure: reportTests(fail) → BLOCKED → retry/policy-route/escalate → reassign
- Terminal: rollback → ROLLED_BACK

## Phase 20: Slice Inspector UI

**Goal:** Add a read-only slice inspector page inside the Paperclip UI for viewing orchestrator state.

**Phase 20 — Slice Inspector UI (2026-04-10):**
- Read-only inspector page at `/instance/settings/s4a-slices`
- Manual workflowId input → fetches and displays:
  - State (color-coded badge)
  - Builder agent ID
  - Build fail count
  - Full transition history table with Cedar decision badges
- Frontend: `ui/src/pages/SliceInspector.tsx` + `ui/src/api/s4a.ts`
- Route: mounted under `instance/settings` (company-independent)
- Existing `getStatus` and `getHistory` queries sufficient — no new orchestrator code
- No new backend code — uses existing `/api/s4a-orchestrator` POST route
- No new env gate — page always renders, bridge must be enabled for data
- Data flow verified: getStatus → {state, builderAgentId, buildFailCount}, getHistory → transitions
- Existing lifecycle verified unchanged (10/10 PASS)
- Paperclip commit: 0d69842f pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip (Phase 20)
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 21: UI Mutation Controls

**Goal:** Turn the read-only Slice Inspector into a minimal operator console with state-aware mutation buttons.

**Phase 21 — UI mutation controls (2026-04-10):**
- Extended inspector with: Create Slice, Assign Builder, Retry, Rollback, Approve, Deploy
- State-gated: buttons visible only for valid states, terminal states show "no actions available"
- Auto-refresh after mutations, inline success/error feedback
- API module extended with 6 mutation commands — all via existing bridge POST route
- No new backend code, no new orchestrator code, no new env gate
- Browser proof (Playwright against production build):
  Create → SCOPED → Assign(opencode) → BUILDING → (API) → AWAITING_APPROVAL → Approve → APPROVED → Deploy → DEPLOYED
  7 transitions, all ALLOW, zero errors
- Paperclip commit: 64386c57 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 22: Workflow Listing

**Goal:** Add workflow discovery to the Slice Inspector — list recent workflows instead of requiring manual ID entry.

**Phase 22 — Workflow listing (2026-04-10):**
- "Recent Workflows" panel on the inspector page
  - Auto-loads on page open via `listWorkflows` command
  - Shows: workflowId, status (RUNNING/COMPLETED), start date
  - Click a row to load status + history + action controls
  - Up to 20 workflows, scrollable, refresh button
  - New workflows appear after Create
- Orchestrator: added `listWorkflows` command in adapter-core
  - Queries Temporal `client.workflow.list()` for sliceWorkflow type
  - Returns `[{workflowId, status, startTime, closeTime}]`, max 50
  - Added to harness VALID_COMMANDS
- No new env gate
- Browser proof (Playwright against production build):
  - 20 workflows listed with status badges
  - Click selection loads status + history + action buttons
  - All proofs PASS
- Orchestrator commit: dca2426 pushed to github.com/yosiwizman/s4a-slice-orchestrator
- Paperclip commit: 7348b289 pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified

---

## Phase 23: Multi-Slice Concurrency

**Goal:** Prove and formalize that multiple slice workflows run concurrently with full isolation.

**Phase 23 — Multi-slice concurrency (2026-04-10):**
- **No code changes needed** — Temporal handles each workflow independently, evidence files namespaced by sliceId
- Concurrency proof (2 concurrent workflows, different states):
  - Both created simultaneously (SCOPED)
  - Different builders assigned (opencode vs claude-code)
  - Different test results (A passes → REVIEWING, B fails → BLOCKED)
  - State isolation verified: A=REVIEWING, B=BLOCKED, no cross-contamination
  - History isolation verified: A has 3 transitions, B has 4, no shared data
  - Evidence isolation verified: separate directories, no cross-references
  - Mutation isolation: retry on B doesn't affect A's state
- UI proof: both workflows in Recent Workflows, click to switch, correct status/actions for each
- Paperclip commit: 8a56be7a (docs only) pushed to fork yosiwizman/paperclip
- Upstream paperclipai/paperclip NOT modified
